Reflection

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 

  I make sure my code is functional and secure by writing unit tests that check each important part of my program. 
In this course, I used JUnit tests to verify that my services (Contact, Task, and Appointment) were behaving the way they should. 
I also focus on validating inputs (like checking for nulls, string lengths, and correct formats) so that bad data doesn’t cause problems down the line. Security starts with small checks like these.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? 

  I start by breaking down the requirements and thinking about how the user will interact with the program. 
For example, in this course, I built my services based on clear user needs like "the ID can't be too long" or "the date can't be in the past." 
Each rule in the requirements was directly tested and reflected in the design of my classes. I try to always think from the user’s point of view — what would they expect to happen?

How do I approach designing software? 

  I design software by thinking small first — focusing on one object or service at a time. I make sure each piece does one thing well and can be tested independently.
Writing unit tests as I go helps shape my design because it forces me to make methods clear and predictable. 
I also think about future maintenance — I try to write code that is organized and easy for someone else (or future me) to understand.
